        <p>Vancouver Island is a beautiful island on the west coast of Canada. It is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean. It has beautiful forests, mountains, rivers and ocean waters. The island is about 456km long and 100km wide. It is one of the largest islands in North America.</p>

                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>Vancouver Island is in the southwest of British Columbia, Canada. It is separated from the mainland by several water channels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Johnstone Strait and Queen Charlotte Strait (north and northeast)</li>
                    <li>Strait of Georgia (southeast)</li>
                    <li>Strait of Juan de Fuca (southwest, separates the island from the US)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To the west of the island is the Pacific Ocean and to the north is Queen Charlotte Sound. These waters are part of the Salish Sea that also includes Puget Sound.</p>

        <h2>How was Vancouver Island formed?</h2>
        <p>Millions of years ago, a small ocean plate called the Kula Plate was under the Pacific Ocean. About 55 million years ago, part of this plate moved under North America and pushed up land. This process created mountains and made Vancouver Island part of the continent.</p>

        <h2>Geology</h2>
        <p>Vancouver Island has high mountains in the center like Golden Hinde. The island is mostly made of volcanic and sedimentary rock.</p>
        <p>Vancouver Island is in a very active earthquake zone. The Juan de Fuca Plate is moving under the island, making it part of the Ring of Fire. In 1700, a huge earthquake (Cascadia earthquake) happened off the coast.</p>

        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <p>Vancouver Island has the mildest climate in Canada. Even in January, temperatures on the coast are usually above 0°C. In summer, the warmest days can reach 28-33°C. The southeast part of the island has a Mediterranean-style climate, with warm summers and many vineyards.</p>
        <p>The island's mountains affect the weather. The west coast gets a lot of rain while the east coast is much drier.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hucuktlis Lake (west coast) gets 6650mm of rain per year: the wettest place in North America</li>
            <li>Victoria (southeast) gets only 608mm of rain per year: the driest part of the island</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mountains and landscapes</h2>
        <p>A mountain range called the Vancouver Island Ranges runs through the island. This creates a wet, rugged west coast and a drier, rolling east coast. The highest mountain is Golden Hinde (2195m), located in Strathcona Provincial Park in the center of the island. This park has the only glaciers on the island including the Comox Glacier.</p>
        <p>The west coast is rocky and mountainous, with many fjords, bays and inlets. The island's interior has many rivers and lakes. The largest lake is Kennedy Lake near Ucluelet.</p>

        <h2>Rainforest</h2>
        <p>The west side of Vancouver Island has a rainforest with huge trees like western red cedar, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce. The south and east parts of the island have Douglas fir, arbutus trees and Garry oak. Some of the world's tallest Douglas fir trees were found here.</p>

        <h2>Wildlife</h2>
        <p>Vancouver Island has many wild animals. Black bears, Roosevelt elk and Vancouver Island marmots live in the forests. The island has more cougars than anywhere else in North America. The Vancouver Island wolf is only found in the north part of the island. Harbour seals and river otters live along the coast.</p>
        <p>Some animals like grizzly bears, moose and skunks live on the mainland but not on Vancouver Island. But in 2016, two grizzly bears were seen swimming near the island.</p>

        <h2>Rivers</h2>
        <p>Vancouver Island has many rivers. Some are short, but they carry a lot of water.</p>
        <p>Here are some important rivers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Somass River: Flows through Alberni Valley</li>
            <li>Nimpkish River: The biggest river in North Vancouver Island</li>
            <li>Englishman River: Located near Parksville, north of Nanaimo</li>
            <li>Cowichan River: Flows through Cowichan Valley in South Vancouver Island</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ocean</h2>
        <p>The waters around Vancouver Island have many sea animals. Orcas (killer whales), humpback whales and grey whales live here. Orcas travel in different groups. Some stay in the north, some in the south and some move around. The island's rivers and lakes are great places to find trout, salmon and steelhead fish.</p>
        <p>Sea otters were once almost gone because of hunting. Between 1969 and 1972, some sea otters from Alaska were brought to Vancouver Island. Now there are over 3000 sea otters on the west coast of the island.</p><br>
