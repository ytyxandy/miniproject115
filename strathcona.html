    <h1>Strathcona Provincial Park</h1>
    <p>Strathcona Provincial Park is the oldest provincial park in British Columbia and the largest park on Vancouver Island. It was created in 1911 and is named after Donald Alexander Smith, the 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, a wealthy philanthropist and railway pioneer.</p>
    <p>The park is located in the Strathcona Regional District. It is also part of the Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve, which was established in 2000. This reserve includes three watersheds in the western part of the park.</p>

    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>Strathcona Provincial Park is located 9 kilometers east of Gold River and 25 kilometers west of Campbell River. It covers an area of 2458kmÂ² and contains the highest peaks of the Vancouver Island Ranges. Some famous mountains in the park include:</p>
