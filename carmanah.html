    <h1>Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park</h1>
    <p>Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park is a remote wilderness park located on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, within the traditional territory of the Ditidaht First Nation. The park covers 16450 hectares and is near the West Coast Trail of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. It includes the entire Carmanah Creek drainage and part of the Walbran River drainage, both of which flow into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p>The park is known for its lush temperate rainforest, with ancient old-growth trees such as giant western redcedar, Sitka spruce and Douglas-fir. Some trees are over 1000 years old, and the Carmanah Giant, Canada's tallest tree at 95.8 meters, is located here.</p>
    <p>Access to the park is via gravel logging roads from Port Alberni, Lake Cowichan, or Port Renfrew. However, some trails, including those to the Carmanah Giant, are currently inaccessible due to the deterioration of the park's boardwalk system. Despite a funding increase in 2012, the park's budget cuts have made it difficult to maintain the trails and prevent illegal activities like cedar poaching and logging.</p>

    <h2>Ecology</h2>
    <p>Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park is located within the coastal western hemlock biogeoclimatic zone, which is divided into three subzones. The area closest to the ocean is the CWH Southern Very Wet Hypermaritime subzone, also known as the "spruce fringe forest." It is dominated by Sitka spruce, which can survive the sea spray, and other plants like leatherleaf polypody fern and evergreen huckleberry.</p>
    <p>Just inland is the CWH Submontane Very Wet Maritime subzone, which makes up most of the park. Here, you will find coniferous trees such as western hemlock, coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar and Sitka spruce. The mild and humid climate encourages the growth of epiphyte communities (plants that grow on other plants) in the forest canopy.</p>
    <p>The park's forest is very rich, with twice the biomass of tropical rainforests. Marbled murrelets, a type of seabird, have also been spotted nesting in the area.</p>
