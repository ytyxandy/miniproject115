    <h1>Comox Glacier</h1>
    <p>The Comox Glacier is located in Strathcona Provincial Park on Vancouver Island. It is about 30km southwest of Courtenay and 1km west of Argus Mountain.</p>
    <p>The highest point of the Comox Glacier is 1960m, which is a rocky outcrop on the north side of the glacier. This peak is called the Comox Glacier summit, but it does not have an official name.</p>
    <p>The Comox Glacier is part of the Vancouver Island Ranges, which are in the Insular Mountains.</p>

    <h2>Routes to the Comox Glacier</h2>
    <p>There are two main routes to reach the Comox Glacier:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Comox Glacier Trail (Frog's Pond Route): <br> This is the most direct route. It starts where Datsio Creek meets Comox Creek. The trail goes up the valley towards Century Sam Lake, then climbs up a ridge to the west. From there, it follows the ridge to Lone Tree Pass and continues to the south side of the Comox Glacier.</li>
        <li>Kookjai Route: <br> This route starts at Cougar Lake, near the Comox Gap. It passes over Kookjai Mountain and Black Cat Mountain, before joining the Comox Glacier Trail at Lone Tree Pass.</li>
    </ol>
