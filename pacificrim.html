    <h1>Pacific Rim National Park Reserve</h1>

    <div class="div1">
        <p>Pacific Rim National Park Reserve is a national park on Vancouver Island, covering an area of 511km². It includes three regions: Long Beach, the Broken Group Islands and the West Coast Trail. The park is located in the Pacific Coast Mountains, known for its rugged coastlines and temperate rainforests.</p>
        <p>The park has many types of plants, including western hemlock, Sitka spruce and western red-cedar. It is home to various animals, like humpback whales and ochre sea stars in the ocean and Vancouver Coastal Sea wolves on land. People visit the park for activities such as surfing and windsurfing at Long Beach, sea kayaking around the Broken Group Islands and hiking on the West Coast Trail. Camping is available in all areas and scuba diving can be done in winter at Long Beach and the Broken Group.</p>

        <h2>Long Beach</h2>
        <p>The Long Beach Unit is a 212km² area of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, located along Highway 4 between Tofino and Ucluelet. It features several beaches, short trails and a campground. Notable beaches include Wickaninnish Bay, Long Beach, Combers Beach and Florencia Bay, with the latter being more sheltered.</p>
        <p>The two bays are connected by a 3km trail called the Nuu-chah-nulth Trail, and the KWisitis Visitor Centre offers information about the area. The Pacific Rim Visitor Centre, located at the park entrance along Highway 4, is the main information center. A separate administrative building is closer to the campground and the airport.</p>
        <p>Grice Bay, located on the north side of Long Beach, has a boat launch for paddling or accessing nearby areas like Clayoquot Sound and Browning Passage. Additionally, Kennedy Lake, located nearby, offers a picnic and swimming area, with a campground and boat launch at the nearby Kennedy Lake Provincial Park.</p>

        <h2>Broken Group Islands</h2>
        <p>The Broken Group Islands unit is a 106km² area in Barkley Sound, made up of over one hundred small islands. It is mostly marine, with rocky reefs and kelp beds. The island beaches range from sandy areas to weathered rocks. The outer islands, like Wouwer, Howell, Cree, and Benson Islands, are exposed to strong winds and swells, especially in the channels between the islands and Vancouver Island. The islands are uninhabited, but there are archaeological sites showing former village locations.</p>
        <p>The Broken Group Islands are mainly used for sea kayaking, along with camping and wildlife viewing. Motorboats are not allowed to land on islands with campsites, but other boats can pass through the area and dock at Port Alberni. Kayaks are launched from Toquart Bay, Ucluelet, or Bamfield, with camping available on seven islands: Hand, Turret, Gibraltar, Willis, Dodd, Clarke and Gilbert islands. The names of the islands come from a survey map made in 1861.</p>

        <h2>West Coast Trail</h2>
        <p>The West Coast Trail Unit covers 193km² and includes the famous 75km hiking trail between Port Renfrew and Bamfield. The trail was originally created in 1889 as part of a telegraph line to connect Victoria with lighthouses along the coast.</p>
        <p>Over the years, several development attempts were made in the area, but they failed, and parts of the trail were abandoned. In the 1960s, the provincial government set aside land around the trail for conservation, and after negotiations, it became part of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve in 1970.</p>
        <p>Today, the trail runs through rocky beaches, rainforests and muddy terrain, and is typically completed in 6 or 7 days. The trail has campsites along the way, including at Tsusiat Falls and Keeha Beach. The southern trailhead is at Port Renfrew, and the northern trailhead is at Bamfield. A separate 7 km trail leads to Cape Beale from Bamfield. The West Coast Trail is a challenging and scenic route, popular with hikers and outdoor enthusiasts.</p>
